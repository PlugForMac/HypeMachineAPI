## Installation

### Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate HypeMachineAPI into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:
